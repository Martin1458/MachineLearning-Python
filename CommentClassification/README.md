# Comment Classification using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec

I've concidered the file "GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin" to be too big to be uploaded to GitHub, so please download it directly from Google News: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing and extract it as "/CommentClassification/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin".
