# Comment Classification using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec

I've concidered the file "GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin" to be too big to be uploaded to GitHub, so please download it directly from Google News: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing and extract it as "/CommentClassification/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin".

The datasets "aclImdb", "txt_sentoken" and "stanfordSentimentTreebank" are provided for free by Cornell and the Stanford University.
Download "aclImdb" from https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment, just click on the "Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0". 
Get "txt_sentoken" from http://cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/, its the "polarity dataset v2.0".
"stanfordSentimentTreebank" is available here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/. Click on "Main zip file with readme (6mb)" under the Dataset downloads panel on the right hand side of the page.
Please extract the folders named "aclImdb", "txt_sentoken" and "stanfordSentimentTreebank" to the this folder ("CommentClassification").
